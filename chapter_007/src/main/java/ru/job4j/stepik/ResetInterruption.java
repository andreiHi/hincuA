 * Java doesn't provide any safe mechanism to stop the running thread, instead it provides so called interruption,

 * Although if the policy is unknown, or  the running thread doesn't handle interruption exception,
 * it should not swallow it, but instead reset the interruption status back (as methods which could throw InterruptedException﻿
 * clear the interruption status which has to be reset back).
 * So, in the code below how do you restore and check for the interruption status of the running thread?
